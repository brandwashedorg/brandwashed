    <h1>Designing Desire: How Rhode Blends Aesthetic and Authenticity</h1>
    <div class="meta">By Ankshita Tiwari• August 17, 2025</div>
    
    <p>When the world needed a fresh, authentic skincare brand that also provides makeup products and serves real purpose, 
	it found Rhode Skin by Hailey Rhode Bieber.Rhode Skin is essentially a skincare brand, focusing on the same thing millions 
	of brands do: protection and nourishment of skin, minimizing breakouts, and stealing the hearts of the target market of a skincare brand.
	But what sets Rhode apart from the other brands, and why did it rise to the fame it currently holds?</p>
    
    <p>Well, let us give a round of applause to the marketing team behind this company. 
	From creating products that are set apart from other brands i.e. peptide lip tints, pocket blushes, to 
	associating different flavours of their products with unique foods  (like the Strawberry Glaze or Lemonade treatments) 
	which has created a ripple effect among other companies to promote their products through “sensory branding”, the brand has managed
	to create an image for itself that has quite literally created not only makeup trends (strawberry makeup) but also popularized a whole
	aesthetic: the "clean girl."</p>
	
	<p>A major part of their brand image and marketing has been the one and only founder and creative director, Hailey Bieber.
	She is the face of Rhode Skin. From "GRWM" videos to even the posters promoting the products, everything has been done by Hailey.
	Along with her, there have been multiple famous uprising celebrities, such as Tate McRae, Alix Earle, Alex Consani, and Lori Harvey,
	who have very much contributed to the attention that the target market (teenagers to 30-year-olds) has been given.</p>
	
	<p>And the cherry on top includes the social media feed. The brand currently has over 3 million followers on Instagram and more 
	than 1.5 million followers on TikTok, with reports showing that over 46% of Rhode’s early sales came from TikTok Shop and related 
	viral content. The brand launches products according to seasons as well, with the new Lemonade Lip Treatment recently launched to
	cater to summer aesthetics. It follows trends but does not forget its individual philosophy:Simplicity. Affordability. Authenticity.
	Quality. Transparency.In conclusion, Rhode isn’t just another celebrity beauty brand. It’s a masterclass in modern branding, 
	built on influence, aesthetic, and sensory resonance; making it one of Gen Z’s favourite faces in the beauty industry.</p>
